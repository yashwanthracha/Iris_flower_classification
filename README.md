Introduction:
The classification of iris flowers is a well-known machine learning example.
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, based on the measurements of their length and width.
The iris dataset has three classes of flowers, each with four features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.

First we have a build a model on logistic regression which got less accuracy and then we have used support vector machine.

SVM is known for its results in binary and multi-class operations; This makes it ideal for the iris dataset, which has three different species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
Our work begins with preprocessing of the Iris dataset, including data normalization and feature selection to improve the performance of SVM.

Using Logistic regression we got accuracy score of 97%.
Support Vector Machine got 100% accuracy score.
